# Library-Management
To demonstrate Library's functionality by using java OOP's and Mysql concept

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for books in the library catalog.
- **User Management**: Register and manage library users (members and staff).
- **Lending System**: Track borrowed books, due dates, and return processes.
- **Search Functionality**: Efficiently search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on overdue books and user activity.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- MySQL Server

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system

## Configure Database
- Create a new MySQL database (e.g., library_db).
- Execute the SQL scripts located in the sql directory to create tables and populate initial data.
- Update your database connection settings in the application (if necessary).

## Build the Project
Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).
Ensure all dependencies are included and configured.

## Run the Application
- Execute the main class (e.g., Main.java) to start the application.
  
## Usage
- Admin Functions: Access the admin panel to manage books and users.
- User Functions: Users can borrow and return books, check due dates, and search for available titles.

## Object-Oriented Principles
This system exemplifies key OOP principles:
- Encapsulation: Data related to books and users is encapsulated within dedicated classes.
- Inheritance: Shared behaviors and properties are defined in base classes and inherited by specific types.
- Polymorphism: Methods can be overridden in subclasses for tailored functionality.
